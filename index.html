                <h2>Common Types of Embezzlement</h2>
                <p>
                    Embezzlement is a type of financial fraud in which a person misappropriates or steals assets that have been entrusted to them, such as money or property. There are several common types of embezzlement, including:
                </p><p>   
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Skimming</b> occurs when a person takes cash from a business before it is recorded on the books. For example, a retail employee might steal some money from the register before ringing up a sale.</li>
                    <li><b>Billing schemes:</b> In a billing scheme, an employee submits fraudulent invoices for goods or services that were never delivered. The employee then pockets the money that is paid for these invoices.</li>
                    <li><b>Payroll schemes:</b> In this type of embezzlement, an employee manipulates the company’s payroll system to inflate their salary or create fake employees. The employee then pockets the extra money that is paid out.</li>
                    <li><b>Check fraud:</b> Check fraud involves altering or forging checks to steal money. For example, an employee might write a review to themselves or change the payee on a tab to divert funds to their account.</li>
                    <li><b>Misuse of company assets</b> occurs when an employee uses company assets, such as a company car or credit card, for personal use.</li>
                    <li><b>Ponzi schemes:</b> In a Ponzi scheme, an individual or company promises high returns on an investment but uses new investors’ money to pay off earlier investors. This type of scheme needs to be more sustainable and typically results in significant financial losses for investors.</li>
                </ol>
